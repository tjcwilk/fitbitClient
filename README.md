# fitbitClient
A simple python client for talking to the fitbit API

# SECRETS

The client will need some secret credentials to talk to your account using the fitbit API. For obviouse reasons,
I havent left my own in this repo! Create the file secrets.py in the root of this folder. Create the variables 
APP_CLIENTID, APP_CLIENTSECRET and APP_AUTHCODE with your own variables. To get them, log into the fitbit
developer webpage and create a new application. Then follow this URL to get the AUTHCODE - https://dev.fitbit.com/docs/oauth2/#authorization-page
